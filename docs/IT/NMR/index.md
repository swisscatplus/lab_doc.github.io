This is the NMR doc for IT.

In order to make the NMR spectral characterization integrated in the global analytical workflow, we are developing an entirely automated high-resolution 400 MHz NMR setup using a Bruker SampleJetTMAutosampler for highsample throughput directly interfaced with a Universal Robot UR5e.

{: .important }
> The SampleJet is controlled via its own library and the experiments are sent through Ibruk and its corresponding 
> library. Ibruk adds the experiment to its queue and launch them one after another.

The repository for the NMR API is accessible here : [GIT AUTOMATIC NMR](https://github.com/swisscatplus/AutomaticNMR){: .btn .btn-blue }

It contains the API and control application to access the 2 libraries developed to control the NMR.

The documents are available here [Documents NMR](https://swisscatsrv1.epfl.ch/index.php/apps/files/files/95642?dir=/SwissCat-share/1_Projects/P4%20-%20Auto%20NMR){: .btn .btn-blue }
