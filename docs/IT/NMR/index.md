This is the NMR doc for IT.

The NMR is using a SampleJet with a carousel. 

{: .important }
> The SampleJet is controlled via its own library and the experiments are sent through Ibruk and its corresponding 
> library. Ibruk adds the experiment to its queue and launch them one after another.

The repository for the NMR API is accessible here : [GIT AUTOMATIC NMR](https://github.com/swisscatplus/AutomaticNMR){: .btn .btn-green }

It contains the API to access the 2 libraries developed to control the NMR.
