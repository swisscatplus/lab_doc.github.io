This is the Omnifire doc for IT.

We designed and are currently building an integrally automated platform that will manage the process from unknown peak detection by LC-MS in crude reaction to its full molecular characterization. In order to perform this sequence, it will be required to integrate at the sample and data level:

*LC-DAD-MS
*Chiral SFC-MS
*Preparative LC
*Liquid handler/SPE
*Fourier-transform Infrared spectroscopy
*Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy
*High resolution Ion Mobility
*High resolution mass with Q-TOF spectrometry
*High-resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

The complete sequence of analysis is performed on the same aliquot and the samples are prepared for NMR analysis without any human intervention.

The Omnifire control is using an implementation of GLAS.

GLAS documentation is available here : [GLAS](https://github.com/swisscatplus/glas){: .btn .btn-blue }
