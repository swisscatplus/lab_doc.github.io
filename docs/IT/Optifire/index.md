In order to optimize catalytic reactions, it is required to follow the evolution of various chemical species in real time. Some analytical tools, such as infrared or benchtop NMR can be used for this purpose. However, in order to collect data in the most standardized way as possible, we plan to automatize the simultaneous in-line analysis of our three chemical reactors. For this purpose, the benchtop NMR requires to be multiplexed with the three reactors and to perform online solvent exchange in order to be able to perform parallel measurements. A microfluidic system is being developed in order to extract the reaction media and prepare it for NMR analysis.
